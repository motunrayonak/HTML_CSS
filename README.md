I know I'm currently lagging behind, but i am back to studying again.and i'm confident that i will catch up soon.
My gain in learning CSS is to gain the skills needed to create visually appealing and well-structured web pagrs.
I want to understand how to style element effectively and build clean,responsive designs as i work towards becoming a proficient front-end web developer.
