    <h1> THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>

    <h2> MERCURY </h2>
    <P> Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and also the smallest in the solar system. It is a rocky planet with a surface covered in craters,much like the moon</P>
    <p> Because mercury has almost no atmosphere, it cannot retain heat. This causes extreme temperatures, with very hot days and freezing cold nights.</p>
    <p> It takes mercury just 88days to orbit the sun, making it the fastest planet. However, it rotate slowly, so one day on mercury is longer than it's year</p>

    <h3> VENUS</h3>
    <p> Venus is the second planet from the sun and is similar in size to Earth.</p>
    <p> It has a thick,toxic atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, which traps heat and makes it the hottest planet in the solar system.</p>
    <p> Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets. A day on venus is longer than it's year.</p>

<h4> EARTH</h4>
<P> Earth is the third planet from the sun and the only known planet to support life.</P>
    <p> About 70% of earth surface is covered by water, and it has a protective atmosphere rich in oxygen and nitrogen.</p>
<p> Earth orbit the sun in 365 days and rotate once every 24hours, creating day and night.</p>

<h5> MARS </h5>
<P> Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and is known as the Red planet because of it's reddish, dusty surface.</P>
<p> It has thin air, mostly carbon dioxide, and temperatures are cold. Evidence suggest water once exited on mars.</p>
<p> Mars has two small moons and large volcanoes and valleys. A day on mars is about 24.6hours, and a year is 687 Earth days.</p>

<h6> JUPITER </h6>
<P> Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest in the solar system. It has a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</P>
<p> It has a great red spot,a giant storm, and dozens of moon, Including the four largest called the Galilean moons.</p>
<p> Jupiter has strong gravity and a fast rotation, completing one day in about 10 hours, while it orbits the sun in 12 Earth years.</p>

<div> This blog discuses the first five planets in the solar system: Mercury,Venus,Earth,Mars,Jupiter. Mercury is the smallest and nearest to the sun, no atmosphere and extreme temperatures. Venus, often called Earth's twins, is covered in thick clouds and is the hottest planet due to it's dense, toxic atmosphere. Earth is the only known planet that supports life, thanks to it's water, breathable air, and stable environment. Mars, known as red planet, is cold and dusty, with evidence suggesting it once had water. Jupiter, the largest of them all, is famous for it's great red spot-a giant storm- and it's many natural satelites . </div>
